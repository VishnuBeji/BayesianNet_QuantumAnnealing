# Bayesian Network Structure Learning with Quantum Annealing on ALARM Dataset

## Introduction
In the paper [O'Gorman et al.](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjst/e2015-02349-9), we are introduced to the concept of Bayesian Network structure learning with  encoding into a **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation** (**QUBO**) problem. 

## Problems Used
Patient monitoring system from ALARM dataset:

The **QUBO** problem is solved using **Quantum Annealing** approach using the libraries and **quantum annealers** provided by [D-Wave Systems](https://www.dwavesys.com/).
